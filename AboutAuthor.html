                    <p>I was raised in southern Illinois in a town so small I knew everybody and their pets. And they all knew me. I was one of six kids and we spent our summer days traipsing through the fields and forests hunting for adventure. We often found it. And sometimes it found us. Always, it was fun and often, we laughed so hard we blew Orange Crush or Grape Nehi Soda out our noses. I still avoid Grape Nehi ... just in case.

                    I attended Southern Illinois University and studied Biology and Computer Science. After that, I worked for a computer software company. I helped people with their computer problems ("Did you try turning it off and on again?") and some technical writing. I didn't know at the time, but tech writing was great training for writing for kids because it taught me to be a fierce self-editor. 

                    Now, I live in Chicago with my family. I visit lots of schools each year to share my love of reading and my writing journey with kids and educators.

                   The End.</p>
